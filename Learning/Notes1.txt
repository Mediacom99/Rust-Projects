The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /home/edoardo/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /home/edoardo/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /home/edoardo/.profile
  /home/edoardo/.bashrc
  /home/edoardo/.config/zsh/.zshenv

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.
